GodState is a dumb representation of the game. Godly because it exposes all hands.
View is an individual player's view of the game, a filter on GodState.
Executor runs a game, asking Players to make choices and then updating the board (GodState and the Players).
  There are two modes of play:
    - Normal mode. It just runs.
    - God Mode. The board is shown, and an omnipotent observer can change actions.
