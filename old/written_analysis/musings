If player A and B=A+1 both have exactly 1 playable card, which is the same card, and B does not have the next card in the sequence, then it doesn't matter who plays it.

So, if A knows about his card, he can DISCARD it, as long as this informs B that B has it, so that B can play it. This is an alternative to A playing and then B discarding.

If there are already 14 cards in the discard pile, and the game is only partway-over, it is clear that some piles just aren't getting finished. Cut losses and toss some high cards, if appropriate

Everything embeds information. The decision about whether or not to hint is itself information. Which card to discard is information.

Perhaps: colour hint is play order, number hint is state reduction. Colour hints are restrictive in entropy, but plays cost very little entropy (since you just need to know 'playable' rather than 'green four'). If some player knows that they have no playable card in indexes 1 and 3 (perhaps they know those are 5s, and we've only played 1s and 2s), then giving them a play hint of either 1 or 3 can mean something more.

Entropy of the hands decreases with hints, increases with plays discards and draws. Want to minimize entropy loss on plays and discards, maximize entropy on hint.

2 twos on the bottom is a nightmare - what about 2 threes? Playing 2,3,4,5 is hard with 4 players, but 3,4,5 might be much more doable. Therefore, prefer discarding 3s and 4s of colors that already have 2s played

Suppose 2 blue 2s are on the bottom, and none of the higher blue cards have been discarded. Even if you get to choose who draws the second-last card, the higher cards are randomly assigned, and some configurations just don't work.
// in a 4-player game, if both blue 2s are on the bottom, and none of the higher
// blue cards are discarded, (a) how many configurations are there, and (b) even
// if the drawer of the 2nd last card is discretionary, how many ways are
// unwinnable?
// WLOG, P_3 has 5
// P_0 might as well draw the 2. If it was P_1, then P_0 cannot help (assuming
// perfect score)
// P_1 must have the 3 and P_2 the 4. How many ways can the 3 and 4 be dealt out
// as such? 4 cards between 4 players - (7 choose 3) = 35 ways. P_1 has exactly
// 1 3, and P_2 has exactly 1 4: 9 ways 2 and 1 plus 1 and 2: 3 + 3 = 6 2 and 2
// = 1 so 16 16 / 35 = ~0.5
// 5 colours * P(2 blue 2s on the bottom)==1/1225 * 16/35 = 0.0019.
So I probably can't be perfect 99.9% of the time, since I would run into the 2s
problem. 99% is achievable. 99%*25 + 1%*24 = 24.99 points, on average
HOWEVER, choosing who plays and hints is important. If a player has lots of future-playable
cards, they shouldn't be the one discarding in a discard loop. If they are, then THEY draw
more critical cards, and become a bottleneck at the end of the game
