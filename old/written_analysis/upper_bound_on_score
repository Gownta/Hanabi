Max score is 25. That's a win.

To have 25 points at the end of the game with 4 players, there must be at most 13 cards in the discard pile: 25 cards on the table, 3-4 in each player's hand, none left in the deck, out of 50 cards in total.

Some arrangements of the deck are strictly unwinnable. For example, if all the 1s are on the bottom, there must be at least 20 discards before the first 1 is drawn. These forced failures are rare - about 2M of this variety force a 14th discard, out of 1e56 deck permutations.

Simpler failure cases arise when, for example, both white 2's are on the bottom.
There is exactly one round of play left when the white 2 is played.
